The most important attribute that I have learned as being a software engineer intern, was the ability to learn. Learning is the process of understanding something that is unfamiliar. Once knowledge is acquired, it can then be utilized. This summer I was exposed to new languages and technologies. The methodology of what I thought learning was in a school setting, differs in a professional environment.
<br>

When I first started this internship, I expected strong supportive documentation that would guide me every step of the way. I was naïve to assume that all the information would be served to me on a silver platter. I was even more naïve to assume that I would not have to find and learn new information on my own. When I was initially tasked to solve issue X, I was a bit flabbergasted. How am I expected to solve issue X and where should I go? The first thing I had to learn was being best friends with Google search. There is absolutely nothing wrong with getting help through the internet. But what is more important from using this search engine, is that I was not copying and pasting information I found. In school, it was common for me to just take whatever answers I can find on a teacher’s slide and not give it a second thought. I realized in the beginning of my internship, that I was searching the same thing repeatedly with Google. At the time, I was applying knowledge but not learning it.
<br>

The biggest sin that I have ever committed in this internship, was how I gathered my information. In the previous paragraph I mentioned using Google search. I had a bad habit of clicking the wrong source of information. This source was a YouTube video. I would go on and spend 30 minutes or so watching someone explain their 30 lines of code. This was inefficient as I was wasting project time and my own. Fortunately for Flutter, there are [documentations](https://flutter.dev/docs https://pub.dev/) for every widget created. It entails what the characteristics are and how it may be applied. This also goes in hand with packages that are created by the community. By reading the documentation first, I would be able to solve a task in a quarter amount of the time that I would get from a video. And if I do have trouble, there are sometimes blogs created by other Flutter developers that show how a widget may be implemented.
<br>

In the pursuit of gaining knowledge, I learned that that to code like the best, you must refer to the best. With the internship project just starting, I had the liberty of being the first to code the UI. This included how the code was structured throughout the application. With it being my first “official” project, I made the rookie mistake of not writing clean code. I would put everything on one page, and it would be too messy to understand. The code was cluttered with little readability. I eventually found a public GitHub [repo](https://github.com/flutter/samples) that was made by the official Flutter team. Here I referenced what professional code looked like. I learned new things such as how files (or pages) are organized and routed within a project. Looking at the code now, there is still much improvement I can do!
<br>

As an intern there are time when I feel overwhelmed with my task. As someone who is getting their second degree and was put in a class full of freshman last year, I felt that asking help was a sign of weakness. But by not asking for help, I am hindering what I can learn. I have at most a year of experience in computer science and only two months in Flutter. It makes sense that the greatest insight I can gain immediately, is asking my supervisor for help. Months ago, I figured that a good intern was one who would know how to do everything. However, a good intern is one who has the ability to learn to do everything.
