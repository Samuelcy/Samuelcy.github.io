This week was the first time that I ever thought to myself that “this would have been easier if I did this in another language”.  Why should there be “another” language, and not one universal programming language that can exist to do everything? As I researched this question, I had to look at the history of programming languages and its applications to our world.
<br>

According to the Historical Encyclopedia of Programming Language, there are almost 9000 languages created to this today. It is clear by these numbers, that there will be even more to come by in the future. Programming languages are meant to solves problems. Similarly, how mathematics can be divided into different subgroups such as algebra, geometry, or calculus. Programming languages have their own unique approaches to solve a problem. It is then up to the user to decide which is the best language that can suit his or her needs, based off its characteristics. Here a few attributes of languages that I found:
<br>

**Objective oriented programming vs Function structure**: OOP is based upon data structures called objects which contain internal data or attributes. These features can be accessed and modified. Functional structure on the other hand avoids having changing-state and mutable data. Once something is created, it cannot be changed. Functional structure also contains pure functions, which have the same input always returning the same output.
<br>

**Static typed vs Dynamic typed**: Static typing has variables that are bound to a type and an object. That means the type of the variable must by specified. Dynamic typing on the other hand is a variable being bound to just an object. Dynamic types are checked during run time while static types are checked once it compiles.  Code can then be written quicker with dynamic typing because the type of the variable does not have to be specified.
<br>

**Compiled Languages vs Interpreted languages**: Compiled languages are normally translated into machine code that a processor can execute. This means that these languages tend to be faster as they are executed directly without any extra steps. Interpreters on the other hand, do not compile the source code directly into machine code ahead of execution. Interpreters must run through a program line by line.
<br>

The introduction of programming languages to our world can also be perceived as a product from a business perspective. Software development companies must think about how they need to approach the market with their new language. And consider are who their target customers are and what features will entice new users.  Due to the nature of capitalism, there won’t ever be a universal programming language. Tech companies will always be trying to push their own languages into the market to be the best. 
<br>

In the 1990s, there was an arms race between Netscape and Microsoft called the Browser war.  Both companies at the time were trying to dominate the browser landscape. Java at the time was licensed by Netscape from Sun Microsystems. It was thought that at the time Java would be the language of the browser, but it was too slow for the internet connect speeds that people had at the time. In ten days, Netscape released Mocha which would eventually be named JavaScript. This naming was an agreement between Netscape and Sun Microsystems. Since Java was a powerhouse during the time, JavaScript would ride on the success of its partner to entice new users. 
<br>

To go back to the issue, I mentioned initially with programming in another language, Flutter has a class that utilizes Material Design.  It is a class that allows the user to style their whole application with a few lines of code. I eventually came into some issues with the properties of this class not working. I reminisce to CSS (web platform), on how easy it was to target a specific element on a page and change it to what I want it to be. However, the upside to using Flutter is that I can keep everything I do in one page with less lines of code than three pages (HTML, CSS, JS).
<br>

So, is it possible for a universal language to do everything? Maybe… but I do not think that some people would want a hammer that contains a drill, screw drive, wrench, and a measuring tape. It would be better to have a tool optimized to its max potential to do a certain job. I understand now there is strength for technology, when there are a variety of languages out there. Two languages can solve the same issue, but the user must make a choice on how the programming language’s characteristics such as performance or syntax.
