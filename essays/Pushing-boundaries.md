This week I implemented a feature into an application that would request the user’s current data. This data would then be utilized within the product. The user also has the option to disable this data collection feature. This task got me thinking how much we as users value privacy, as technology is rapidly changing every day. Accessories of the modern day have begun to rely on the information of the user.
<br>

My first part time job in university was working as an IT help desk consultant. My task consisted of answering inquiries in regards of anything technology related for the university. People with diverse levels of technological sophistication came to me with a correspondingly diverse set of questions. The question that stuck out to me the most was an incoming student refusing to use the @hawaii.edu domain which utilizes Google mail. The Gmail client is an important component that is a part of the day to day life for the university. This person’s reasoning was that ‘Google takes your data and sells it’. It took my boss several hours to find a clause within the university’s application stating that how it is mandatory for incoming students to use the Gmail account and that her personal information was not going to be utilized in the way she specified.  This person still did not think that this answer was acceptable. Her view on this situation was “Give up your information or you may not by admitted”, in other words “Consent to the terms of services or else you may not use our product”.

I have come to realize that there is a diverse group of users who use technology. One group may click on the ‘Accept’ button without any hesitation and not read the terms of services. Sometimes, people of this group may get offended when they realize that the Accept button does something that they didn’t know would happen, due to them not reading the terms of service. There is a video on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbb5B85sd0?t=56) in which Mark Zuckerberg explains what the internet is to Congress, in other words elder politicians asking Mark common questions that can be answered by using Google. One politician asked if Facebook tracked the user’s browsing history activity after logging off the platform. He responded that cookies are utilized to correlate activity between sessions which includes security and measuring ads. Cookies have already existed for over 20 years, storing user’s information for their convenience. When I watched this  video, it seemed like the senators were trying to have a “got you” moment with Mark and Facebook, without realizing a majority of technological applications in the world already use the same practices that Facebook does. I am not here to defend or attack the usage of Facebook and what happened at this congress hearing. But it seems to me that there is a new revelation for people who cannot quite grasp concepts of modern technology utilizing personal information.

I do not blame anyone who is skeptical on using a certain product if it asks for their personal information. The definition of privacy has changed throughout the generations.  If you were to tell someone 50 years in the past that the pictures you take and the messages you send are stored somewhere, you would seem crazy. A future without privacy may or may not happen. And I wonder how long we can push the definition of this word.
