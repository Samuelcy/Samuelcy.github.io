ESLint is the first code analysis tool that I have ever used. My impressions of it… are annoying. Having a visual red signal telling me that my code is off, even though it is correct bothers me. And I pondered why we must use coding standards. And realized that this annoyance I feel, is probably felt by others when read my code. Coding standards are not only to help myself, but my peers as well.

If you give an Olympic runner a shoe size that is too small, large, thin, or wide. Or a tennis player a racket that’s weight is a couple grams off. He or she is going to notice that something is wrong. In a high-performance setting, this anomaly could result in a game being lost. Athletes are trained to focus their mind to win a game. And if their mind is else where to their equipment or attire, they may lose their concentration. Similarly, to a software engineering company, professional engineers may be used to seeing their code in a certain way. And when someone’s code does not heed to a company’s standard, this will cause confusion.

I guess this situation can also be applied to a school setting. Specifically, our professors and TA that grade our homework. I have not realized how much of an unorganized mess it was for my professors in my previous computer science classes, when they had to grade 100s of homework. With each containing code in a unique style. This results in valuable time being spent from the grader on deciphering the presented coded.

Having standards for code create conformity. It allows one to easily understand what the code is doing. It allows code to be maintained easily. And allows others to collaborate seamlessly. By having a coding standard being introduced early into this class, it allows the class to be uniform for the rest of the semester. And by the time we do the group final project, our coding efficiency is at its peak.
