JavaScript was the first project language that I have ever used. Coming from introductory courses that were offered at UH Manoa which taught Java, Javascript was a breath of fresh air. Besides Dart, I have been using Java this summer to practice for interview coding questions. I took a long break with Java prior to this summer, and it took me a while to be familiar with its syntax again. After going back to JavaScript for this semester, I was able to understand it faster than Java. To me, JavaScript is more desirable than other languages due its syntax and simplicity.

When I learned JavaScript for the first time, I was using videos that I bought off from a course at Udemy. This was the wrong way to learn. I spent countless hours watching someone else code and teach for me. The first assignment for ICS 314 was to learn JavaScript off of FreeCodeCamp’s tutorial. Although this learning process was a bit tedious. I felt much more comfortable with this language. The question and answer format that this website gave reinforced what I was learning. If I answered a question incorrectly, I would know that I was not familiar with the topic. The hints for the solutions were also helpful in guiding my learning experience. This goes in hand with my classes. I can pay attention to a lecture, but my knowledge won’t be tested until I am given an assignment or quiz.

The WODs are an interesting practice that I didn’t think I would experience within the ICS curriculum at UH Manoa. It reminded me of myself of doing a leet code question. I enjoy that WODs can be worked in a group or done individually ( depending on the day). When working with a group, it’s relieving to have someone explain a problem that I don’t know.  WODs are a good way to demonstrate what I know and don’t know from the material being presented. When I was given the first assignment, I had a somewhat clear idea on how to solve it.  But what messed me up when I was doing this WOD, was not knowing the specific syntax to complete the question. This helped me find gaps in my knowledge for the language. With leetcode (and no prior knowledge in “algorithm questions”), I felt like I was thrown out into the wild. The WODs given so far have been approachable. So long as the difficulty increases gradually, I will enjoy doing WODs. Also, the solution videos that Professor Johnson has provided were also straightforward and helpful for my learning experience.
