When I first started my interest in the computer science field, the idea of openness enticed me in. I could go ahead and learn web development for free or mobile development without paying a dime. The amount of free resources out there are outstanding. And because of this, I can become anything and go anywhere. I’m not tethered to work in a certain field or particular state (or country).

At the moment, I’m not sure what field I want to work in. So far, I’ve felt like I had a light scrap of some of the subfields for computer science. I experienced mobile application development and it has been enjoyable. However, I’m interested in pursuing web development and seeing how I would like it. I realized that I enjoy being a “visual creator”. Being able to see my code take shape and color is like being an artist.

When I declared my computer science major last year, I realized that I would be able to take my work anywhere. This sparked an interest in me moving to another country or state. The idea of moving to Korea enticed me and I should have taken it more seriously when I was taking the language at UH Manoa. When looking into how I would be able to work in the country, I found that companies have a preference for foreign workers to have a masters degree from Korea (and proficiency of the language). Similarly how foreign tech workers are in the United States. I pondered if I would even want to have a higher education just to work somewhere else. But I haven’t decided on the answer yet.

With who I work for and what I do, I hope that it’s a job that will allow me to chase enjoyments in life. Not necessarily through money, but I wish that my work is something I can be passionate about. And that my company’s values are impacting the world. Environmental or health care companies are definitely an option for me to work in. I’m not sure how long it’ll take, but I know I’ll get there.
