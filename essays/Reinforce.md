With the ending of this semester, I have been exposed to software engineering concepts that revealed my coding vulnerabilities. One thing I struggle with is organization, ranging from how an application or coding may appear on a page. Fortunately for me, this class has assisted me with my issues.

I do not think I ever have been a creative person. But I learned how important creativity may be when a creation is perceived by others. When creating a web page, I struggled with managing the layout of components. I would make menu bars too large or shapes too small. I would never be able to properly format a page without taking inspiration from other web pages. I was lucky to be introduced to a user interface framework called Semantic UI in this class. Semantic UI provides React components with CSS. This means that I only must worry about having elements on my page such as “Button”, “Grid”, “Container”. Semantic UI will then format all the elements without me having to worry about how it will look! This means that I can then save time since I type less.

Coding standards are a set of guidelines that software engineers adhere to when writing code for a project. As a messy person (who also never cleans his room), I never bothered with keeping to a certain style since I did not think it was necessary. I would put all my code into one file, and it would contain everything from the visual appearances to the api being called and used within it.  Although this may seem fine for me, I realized how much of an impact it made on others. With this semester being my first formal project with peer students, a certain expectation was needed to collaborate with others. Peers or coworkers should not waste time deciphering what a code does. With the introduction of ESLint, it is a code analysis tool that identifies errors to keep code clean. This was a fortunate software that allowed me to keep my code consistent.

This class to me was the most impactful class I have ever taken. A basic class at this college would normally teach the language being used. In this one, there was always a short story or lesson that went with each lecture. It would explain why certain things are utilized and information that would be beneficial for us computer science students. My flaws as a coder were revealed and I am fortunate to be in a position where there is software available to help me with my issues. This should not mean that I should be sloppy with coding. But allow me to realign and strengthen my coding standards.
