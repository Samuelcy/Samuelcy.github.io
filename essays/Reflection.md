The first new thing I was tasked to do for my internship was mobile app development. I reminiscence the golden age it had when it was first introduced. Specifically, the launch of the Apple app store. I remember in middle school that almost every kid owned an iPod touch. It was a new frontier at the palm of our hands. I spent hours at night going through the app store looking for hidden gems. I thought the future for smart phones was boundless. However, this feeling I had felt of excitement and curiosity, has lost its enticement for me in the modern day.

People these days cannot leave their homes without their phones. The smart phone’s importance has been engrained in modern life. The necessities of the phone are built upon the applications within it. There are approximately 3.8 billion users for smart phones. And it is predicted that by the end of 2020, over 188 billion dollars would have been spent for mobile ad spending. There is no stopping for this industry with the number of consumers and money being poured into it.

In the Google Play store, it is leading first with the number of applications at 2.56 million. Apple is coming in second with 1.85. With the saturation of applications, repetitiveness has become prevalent. If you were to search “Clock” in the Google App Store, there would be a limitless number of apps being shown. They would mostly be functionally the same but differ aesthetically. For an indie developer starting out and hoping to make it big, there is a chance that the idea they have for an application was already made. To stand out within the app store, an idea for an app must be unparalleled.
<br>

Companies need applications that compliment their service. It is not a surprise that the most used apps on the app store are synonymous with tech giants such as Facebook. The domain of app store can be broken into different components. Communication or social media is dominated by apps such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Financial companies have created their own apps to allow users to keep track and maintain their money. Mobile games including the Gacha genre are known to generate large amounts of revenue with their gambling like practices. The necessity of an app being downloaded seems to be influenced from what is culturally relevant, livelihood, and enjoyment.

Is the landscape of mobile application dead? No, it is far from it. But the ambitions of an app thriving that is fueled through creativity will have a difficult time in the sea of applications. Frankly, it may just me who is bored with the current state of the app store. I have already downloaded everything I needed that pertains to my life. As technology evolves, mobile applications will adjust to fit the needs of humankind. A decade ago, no one would have been able to predict the usage of facial recognition and augmented reality being readily available to the mass market in a phone. So long as mobile hardware specifications improve, the potential of the phone is endless which is why I am still optimistic I will regain interest in the future.
