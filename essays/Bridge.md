The first human who encountered a river must have been terrified at the sight of it. And beyond this river probably had food that that could fill his or her stomach. This human must get to the other side to obtain this food. The human may swim and possibly drown while going across. Or maybe take the time to go all the around the river to avoid crossing it. Doing this may seem efficient momentarily as the food is obtained. However, this process may be taxing and have a greater cost to the human in the long run. Eventually the human learned how to create a bridge. By spending the extra time to construct this bridge and sophisticate it, the human can get across the river easily. And when any other rivers are encountered, a bridge may be used.

 The bridge in this story is a design pattern. And the river represents issues or problems that software engineers may encounter. A design pattern is a repeatable solution that is applied to commonly occurring problems in software engineering. It is a template that can be used to solve many problems and speed up development.

The factory method is a design pattern that initializes an object of a class and allows other subclasses to use the object that was created. For example, there could be a class that has a constructor that allows an object to fly. A subclass can then use this subclass and apply this to a be used for a plane or a bird. An Anti Pattern is another design pattern goes against the purpose of a design pattern. It describes solutions that results in negative consequences. An example of this may be a user who is inexperienced. A response to a problem may have worse consequences than a good one.

These two design patterns are the first designs pattern that I have ever used in a project. I remember when I first started my real software engineering project, I was relatively new to the language. This meant that I was applying novice mistakes in the beginning. A weak foundation was created in the application as a result. I remember having an API page that would contain ALL the API calls for an application. I realized that this is what some people call the God class. A God class is a class that controls many other classes and is heavily depended on. The solution for this is breaking up the God class into smaller classes to disperse the responsibility. This then helped with debugging and code readability. Eventually I came to learn what a Factory was. Every time that I wanted to use an API, I made a constructor for it. This was repetitive and made the code extraneous. By using a factory, I was able to improve code legibility and length.
<br>
Design patterns are a methodical way of using past experiences to solve issues with a proven solution. It has become an intuition for me to see a commonly recurring problem and apply what I learned before to tackle it on effectively. I havenâ€™t recognized all the problems that a design pattern have given me. But I hope to accumulate all the tools a software engineer needs.
