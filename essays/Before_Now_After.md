It was spring 2019, and I have been accepted to a pharmacy school in Washington. When I heard the news, I felt a strong relief. A relief that I have been accepted, that I have a future, and that I was able to lie my way through an interview. Growing up, I never really had any passion to any of the subjects presented to me. When I entered the University of Hawai’i at Manoa, I chose my Biology major on a whim. To my surprise, it was a pre – health major. This put me on an artificial goal for me to follow. 
<br>

Around 3 months before my graduation back then, I had to figure what I wanted to do with my future. I had to think deep down on passion I have in life. When I was a child, a present I was always asked for was a Lego set. My parents would always praise me for building intricate things. However, to me I was simply following given instructions for the toy. I may have lacked the creativity to build something new without any guidelines, but I enjoyed being able to build something big out of small pieces. As I got older, my fascination with Legos digressed and I found a new interest in video games. For someone who played computer games, I eventually got stuck onto my computer like a glue. Searching for a new occupation, I then came across the Computer Science field. The answer seemed obvious then seemed obvious to me.

It took me a year after declaring my new major to find a professional experience related to computer science. Although it was an online internship, I was exposed to what it is like to work in a professional environment. I have learned a new programming language and project workflow. I didn’t even think I would ever enter the mobile application field. Butut I was able to pick it up and create something! This may be what I would want to do for the rest of my life. I may not be skilled right now, but I enjoy being able to create something.
<br>

When I was learning Dart, I was a bit worried. I thought I would have to be well versed within the language to use Flutter. However, I have only used basic programming structure so far. The definition of a widget describes the configuration of an element. If one were to make a shopping catalog, one would start with a Scaffold widget. A scaffold would provide the basic material design of the application. Within a scaffold, other widgets can then be added on top of it such as containers, columns, or rows. Widgets in practice are like Legos. A base or starting point is created that will latter have smaller refined pieces that are joined with it that will help encompass the whole application.
<br>

An issue I had my first year of computer science for building a project, was that my projects ideas were too big. And what I mean by this was that I did not know how to break up the project into small manageable pieces. With this internship, I was scared when I heard what the whole application would be. I was then given small doable tasks. These accomplished tasks eventually accumulated and make up what the application is now.
<br>

In college, I always assumed that I would not know how to do a certain subject, unless I take that class. With how my classes were structured for my degree, I would not be able to take any specified courses that may be related to an occupation until my final year. I am glad that I was able to get ahead of my introduction classes and be able to achieve something I thought was out of reach. If time commits, I can’t wait to get ahead of my classes this semester and hopefully be a skilled applicant by the time  I graduate. 
There are many subfields within computer science. I will not know what I will enjoy in life until I put myself out there. Whether it be an internship or a computer science class, there is so much for me to explore.  I do not know what I will be doing exactly but I know that I’ll be in a field that I enjoy. When I interviewed for internships this year, I felt a strong relief. A strong relief that I can be honest with myself.
<br>

I sincerely thank everyone who I have met and helped me on the way.
