These essays are a reflection of my experiences working in a software development firm as an intern for the first time in my life. It will consist of what I've worked on, learned, and the challenges that I faced.

## The Signficance of Peer Review

 A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In other words, a team is only as strong as its weakest member. This idiom emphasizes that the success of a group encompasses the accomplishments of the individual members within it. Code reviews or peer reviews are examination of code done by developers. This method is to ensure that the work done creates a quality product. This summer was the first time I had to share my code with others and have it reviewed.	
<br>

The most common way to do code reviews are through “pull request”. This utilizes code repository sites such as Github. Github allows team members to upload their own code, have it reviewed, and merged into a main development branch. These popular features are why Github is used by millions of users. My workflow is usually doing a task, having it uploaded and reviewed, and then evaluating the critiques that I have been given.

So, what exactly do code reviewers look for? Besides syntax, there are other errors that cannot be easily seen. An example is time complexity which is an important factor when running an algorithm. It describes or estimates the time it takes an application to run based upon its input size. There are different algorithms that may be better for small sample sizes or large ones.  Test cases may also be done to understand how a code performs under a set of conditions or variables. Similarly, it is also important to ensure that the code adheres to visual stylistic guidelines such as a font or property for an object.

By doing code reviews, it also allows familiarity with the project for developers. A team might have people assigned to different parts of an assignment, without knowing exactly how another part works. By allowing a code review to be done, it ensures that there is a level of quality within the application.  As the reviewer reviews the code, it is just as important for the reviewee to assist the reviewer. Code should then be more “legible” for the reviewer. This can be done by adding proper descriptions by comments and labelling. The naming of variables, methods and classes are important for the reviewer.

For new members of a team, code reviews are a significant part of mentorship from seasoned engineers. Code reviews create discussion between individuals to discuss how a code should look and behave to a company’s standards. Senior members may also provide knowledge to a new member on how they may improve, fostering a mentorship between individuals.	
 <br>
 
Since my internship is done virtually, I do not have the luxury of having someone take a quick look over my shoulder and check my code. Even though code reviews are standardized within a company, I feel reassured to know that there will at least be someone there to help me even if I am alone physically. These code reviews go beyond debugging as it allows knowledge to be shared between members. Even though I have just started, I look forward to coding reviews as it allows me to become a better software engineer and enhance product quality.
