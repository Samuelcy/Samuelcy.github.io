Gruhb is the first student group project that I have ever done for computer science. The purpose of this project was to provide a list of vendors that are at UH Manoa for students. This list would also provide the menu that these vendors serve. The functionality aspect for this site allows users to add or edit existing vendors.
<br>
With this project, each member came in with a variety of skills. I am not particularly strong with web development but I was able to pull through with adding functionality to our static website. With each milestone, I realized that our group was slow on delivering tasks. There were 3 milestones and 95% of the work done for this project were on the last milestone. If the work we have done to this project were added much earlier, I would have hopped that we could add more functionality to the site. Such example would be adding a filtering system. The filtering system could then filter the list of vendors by name or by menu items. Menu items could also be “tags” that allows user to quickly navigate through the site. Maybe months down the line, an ordering system may be done for this site.
