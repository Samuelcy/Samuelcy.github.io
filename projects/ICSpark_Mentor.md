ICSpark is a computer science mentorship club created at UH Manoa. Our objectives are to teach middle and high schoolers of O'ahu web development skills. We hope that we can inspire the youth to enter the computer science field. ICSpark was originally apart of Dev League, which was a computer science bootcamp. The bootcamp eventually dissolved however the material that were used to teach the bootcampers, were given to us. So far, our first instructional class was in Spring 2019. We mostly had kids that were between 6th and 9th grade. Classes were held every saturday and it was a memorable experience.
