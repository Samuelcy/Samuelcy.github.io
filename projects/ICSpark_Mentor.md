ICSpark is a computer science mentorship club created at UH Manoa. Our objectives are to teach middle and high schoolers of O'ahu web development skills. We hope that we can inspire the youth to enter the computer science field. ICSpark was originally apart of Dev League, which was a computer science bootcamp. The bootcamp eventually dissolved andthe material that were used to teach the bootcampers, were given to us. So far, our first instructional class was in Spring 2019. We mostly had kids that were between 6th and 9th grade. Classes were held every saturday and it was a memorable experience.

It was interesting to observe the technical level of the kids. When I was growing up around their age, I noticed that my peers had issues using a computer. Motor skills were lacked when using the keyboard and mouse. For the newest generation, technology is their second nature. There was even a 7th grader in our class who had a WPM over 100! What was difficult about this class was that every kid had a different programming technical level. Due to our strict schedule, we were unable to go back to previous material. This eventually made issues were students were desperately trying to catch up with the material without understanding it thoroughly.

Due to Covid-19, the program stagnated from our schedule. We were unprepared to move to an online format. Some kids also did not have an accessible computer at home. Our class eventually transitioned to Zoom. This also came with issues. This was a difficult transition for the mentors and the students. In the end, only 8 of our 40 students managed to stay till the end. Being able to readily transition online, is an option that we have to consider now. There can always be unforeseen events and we must do our best to adapt.
