This summer I had the fortunate chance of being in an internship for Ikayzo. For this internship, I entered the mobile development field and learned Dart/Flutter for the first time. With this being my first internship, I had an inside look on how a software engineering company works even though it was done virtually because of Covid-19. My work consistedon producing work and having feedback from my supervisor. This allowed to have a creative approach on how I wanted the application to be. For majority of the application, the visual presentation were dictated by me. I felt almost like it was my own personal project. And I was blessed to have someone critique my code and give me pointers.
