summary: Summer Internship at Ikayzo as a Mobile App Developer

This summer I had the fortunate chance of being in an internship for Ikayzo. For this internship, I entered the mobile development field and learned Dart/Flutter for the first time. With this being my first internship, I had an inside look on how a software engineering company works even though it was done virtually because of Covid-19. My work consisted on producing work and having feedback from my supervisor. The project was a recreational mobile application that was requested by a client. Since the project started right when I joined, I was given a somewhat restrained but creative freedom on how I wanted the application to be. This included how the application looked visually and how the code was rearranged.

I could not have done this project alone. Almost everyday, I was referring to articles online or StackOverflow to help me with my problems. I had to become a problem solver this summer because of how open ended this project was. When I was tasked with this project I only had a couple of weeks to learn the Flutter framework. I sometimes felt that my knowledge was limited to how much I studied. There were many times were I thought "Oh, I didn't know that was a function of Flutter". I would do meticulous things and end up finding a solution that was similar. However, I learned alot about the Flutter framework by jumping into it with this project. The more I do, the more I learn. By winter, I hope to start my own personal mobil application project.
