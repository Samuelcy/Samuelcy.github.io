summary: Creating Groupings for UH Manoa
---

Employed by the University of Hawaii for a part time job, UH Groupings are an online service that allows management for people affiliated with the University of Hawaii. These groupings can be utilized for business purposes. UH Grouping can be broken down by three groups. The basis group is automatically generated and populated by information from UHIMS or banner. The Include group is used to ensure that a member is specifically part of a group. And the eEclude group prevents a member from being part of a group. With these three groups, the owner of the group may use it however he or she pleases.

I'm mostly interested with the web development of UI for this project. This project is still in development and there is still more information to come for this.
