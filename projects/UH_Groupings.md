summary: Creating Groupings for UH Manoa
---

Employed by the University of Hawaii for a part time job, UH Groupings are an online service that allows management for people affiliated with the University of Hawaii. These groupings can be utilized for business purposes. UH Grouping can be broken down by three groups. The basis group is automatically generated and populated by information from UHIMS or banner. The Include group is used to ensure that a member is specifically part of a group. And the exclude group prevents a member from being part of a group. With these three groups, the owner of the group may use it however he or she pleases.

With this project, my interests are within the front end side. It has been a while since I have done web development so it'll take time for me to transition back into it. For this project, the angular frame work is being used. Based off of ICS 314's curriculum, the react framework will be utilized. I'm curious how difficult it will be to use two different frameworks at the same time. This was the first time I am making a product that is being used to serve hundreds to thousands of users. In my first scrum meeting, I got to witness how important user experience was. Such as a search function taking too long to work even though it was a couple of seconds. Or that a page loading faster than another.
